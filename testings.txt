what the frick are personal access tokens???
apparently tokens are used so you dont have to use your password
or something...

in github there are two types of personal access tokens:
"fined-grained" personal access tokens and the personal access token
"classic"

github tells me to use the fine-grained; those seem more secure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

ok after a bit of reading i think tokens are bit like ssh keys but
they dont work the same way; essentially i think tokens are a tool to
better manage your security... i guess.

:D
