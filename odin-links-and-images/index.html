<!-- The "doctype" tag tells the program (usually the web browser) what type of document is; obviously this is a html text. -->
<!DOCTYPE html>

    <!-- Well, this is the head of the page, usually where titles go -->
    <head>

        <!-- this is specifying the set of characters we are using, it seems "UTF-8" has something to do
        with unicode (that i dont quite understand myself yet) but fundamentally this only means the name
        of a set of characters that i am going to use, or something... -->

        <!-- I don't think the tag "title" needs more explanation -->
            <title>Super awesome webpage</title>

    <!-- This is the head tag; but closed. this tells the computer that the head part of the page its over
         usually the finished tags begging with a backward slash "/" -->

        they only get smaller -->
