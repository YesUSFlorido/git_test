<!-- The "doctype" tag tells the program (usually the web browser) what type of document is; obviously this is a html text. -->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- Every html document needs to start with a "<html>" tag, this one it's just specifying the characters of the languages i'm using. -->

    <!-- Well, this is the head of the page, usually where titles go -->
    <head>

        <!-- this is specifying the set of characters we are using, it seems "UTF-8" has something to do
        with unicode (that i dont quite understand myself yet) but fundamentally this only means the name
        of a set of characters that i am going to use, or something... -->

         usually the finished tags begging with a backward slash "/" -->

        they only get smaller -->

            its called an html attribute.
        
            "target" just specifies where to display this link once click on, in this case in a tab
        
            "rel" this tells the relationship between the site and the linked page, this is set like this for security reasons
            -->
